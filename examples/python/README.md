# Rerun Python examples
The simplest example is [`minimal`](minimal/minimal.py). You may want to start there!

Read more about our examples at <https://www.rerun.io/examples>.


## Running our examples with `pixi`
The easiest way of running our examples from within the Rerun repository is to use [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### Building from source

```sh
pixi shell
pixi run py-build
pip install examples/python/minimal
minimal
```

### Using pre-build `rerun-sdk`
For the released version of the SDK, use:
```shell
pixi shell
pip install rerun-sdk==0.15.1
pip install examples/python/minimal
minimal
```

**Note**: the repository checkout tag must match the installed version of `rerun-sdk`.


## Running examples without `pixi`


### Setup
First install the Rerun Python SDK with `pip install rerun-sdk` or via [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock).

> Note: Make sure your SDK version matches the code in the examples.
For example, if your SDK version is `0.15.1`, check out the matching tag
for this repository by running `git checkout v0.15.1`.

### Installing the example
Each example is packaged as a regular Python package, with a `pyproject.toml` file specifying its required dependencies. To run an example, it must first be installed.

For example, to install dependencies and run the toy `minimal` example (which doesn't need to download any data) run:

```sh
pip install -e examples/python/minimal
```

**Note**: it is import to install example in editable mode, which is done using the `-e` flag (short for `--editable`).

Once installed, the example can be run as a regular python module:

```shell
python -m minimal
```

Examples also declare console script, so they can also be run directly:

```shell
minimal
```


### Running the examples
By default, the examples spawn a Rerun Viewer and stream log data to it.

For most examples you can instead save the log data to an `.rrd` file using `plots --save data.rrd`. You can then view that `.rrd` file with `rerun data.rrd`.

(`rerun` is an alias for `python -m rerun`).

NOTE: `.rrd` files do not yet guarantee any backwards or forwards compatibility. One version of Rerun will likely not be able to open an `.rrd` file generated by another Rerun version.


## Datasets
Some examples will download a small datasets before they run. They will do so the first time you run the example. The datasets will be added to a subdir called `dataset`, which is in the repo-wide `.gitignore`.
