If out of tree transform is enabled, a transform does not participate in the transform hierarchy.

This means transforms on this entity do not affect children.
It will however, still be affected by transforms on its parents.

This is automatically enabled if any of the the transform components are present multiple times.
Setting this to false for a transform that has multiple instances of the same transform component,
will result in an error.
