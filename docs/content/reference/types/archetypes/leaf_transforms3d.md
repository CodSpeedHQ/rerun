One or more transforms between the parent and the current entity which are *not* propagated in the transform hierarchy.

For transforms that are propagated in the transform hierarchy, see [`archetypes.Transform3D`].

From the point of view of the entity's coordinate system,
all components are applied in the inverse order they are listed here.
E.g. if both a translation and a max3x3 transform are present,
the 3x3 matrix is applied first, followed by the translation.

## Components

**Optional**: [`LeafTranslation3D`](../components/leaf_translation3d.md), [`LeafRotationAxisAngle`](../components/leaf_rotation_axis_angle.md), [`LeafRotationQuat`](../components/leaf_rotation_quat.md), [`LeafScale3D`](../components/leaf_scale3d.md), [`LeafTransformMat3x3`](../components/leaf_transform_mat3x3.md)
