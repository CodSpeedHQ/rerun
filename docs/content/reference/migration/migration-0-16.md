## `timeless` replaced by `static`
The concept of _timeless_ data has been replaced by _static_ data.
Except for the name change, it is mostly the same.

Static data is data that shows up at all times, on all timelines.

In 0.15 you could log a component as timeless once, and then change it to be temporal (non-timeless) later (or the other way around). This is no longer allowed for static data.
Now, once you log something (a specific component on a specific entity) as static, it must stay static forever.
Conversely, if you log something as temporal (non-static), it must not be logged as static in the future.

Static data is most often used for `AnnotationContext` and `ViewCoordinates`.


#### C++
```diff
- rec.log_timeless("world", rerun::ViewCoordinates::RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP);
+ rec.log_static("world", rerun::ViewCoordinates::RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP);
```

#### Python
```diff
- rr.log("world", rr.ViewCoordinates.RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP, timeless=True)
+ rr.log("world", rr.ViewCoordinates.RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP, static=True)
```

#### Rust
```diff
- rec.log_timeless("world", &rerun::ViewCoordinates::RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP)?;
+ rec.log_static("world", &rerun::ViewCoordinates::RIGHT_HAND_Z_UP)?;
```




## `MeshProperties` replaced by `TriangleIndices`
In PR [#6169](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/6169) we replaced `MeshProperties` with `TriangleIndices`. We could do this thanks to simplifcations in our data model.

#### C++
```diff
  rerun::Mesh3D(positions)
-     .with_mesh_properties(rerun::components::MeshProperties::from_triangle_indices({{2, 1, 0}}))
+     .with_triangle_indices({{2, 1, 0}})
```

#### Python
```diff
  rr.Mesh3D(
      vertex_positions=â€¦,
-     indices=[2, 1, 0],
+     triangle_indices=[2, 1, 0],
  ),
```

#### Rust
```diff
  rerun::Mesh3D::new(positions)
-     .with_mesh_properties(rerun::MeshProperties::from_triangle_indices([[2, 1, 0]]))
+     .with_triangle_indices([[2, 1, 0]])
```
